# Hidden founders web coding challenge
This is my **Backend** participation for the challenge. 
The **Frontend** is linked on another repository which you can check from the link [Nearby Shops Front End](https://github.com/Alhydra/Nearby-shops.frontend).

The backend server is built using **Nodejs** using **ExpressJs** and **MongoDb**.




Instructions
---------------

Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Alhydra/Nearby-shops.backend.git

```

To run the server you need to run the MongoDb server using the command **mongod** on your local machine.

After it's successfully loaded.
You can run the server using the start script.

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn start
```
The server will start on port 3001.

Once you run the server, you can add pre-defined dummy data using the calling the route **http://localhost:3001/setup**
